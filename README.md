# forsythia_dev
My development sandbox for the Grammar Editor and other aspects of the Forsythia project by John Alexander Greene.

Using Forsythia Grammar Editor to learn some Java. 
DONE: Added a palette menu and some color palettes. Made the stroke width as thin as possible. 
DONE: have it read palettes from an external text file, change the palette menu, change the colors in the renderer instance.
TODO: clean up all the debugging lines and add a default selection in the palette menu.
TODO: make it all look nicer. Look for UI libraries.
TODO: Add something that searches adobe's color api's for palettes based on keywords, reads a color.adobe.com palette by name or whatever makes sense. 
TODOAdd a menu for stroke width and color. 
Then see what else comes to mind.
