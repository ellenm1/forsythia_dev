# forsythia_dev
My development sandbox for the Grammar Editor and other aspects of the Forsythia project by John Alexander Greene.  

Using Forsythia Grammar Editor to learn some Java.   
DONE: Added a palette menu and some color palettes. Made the stroke width as thin as possible.  
=======
DONE: Added a palette menu and some color palettes. Made the stroke width as thin as possible and gray.  
DONE: Set default mode to Intermittant, Stopped, default export image size to 4800.
DONE: have it read palettes from an external text file, change the palette menu, change the colors in the renderer instance.   
TODO: clean up all the debugging lines and add a default selection in the palette menu.  
TODO: make it all look nicer. Look for UI libraries.  
TODO: Add something that searches adobe's color api's for palettes based on keywords, reads a color.adobe.com palette by name or whatever makes sense.   
DONE: Add randomization for the color super-thin stroke that is in there for now.
TODO: Add a menu for stroke width and color.
TODO: Add filter tags for stroke width and color, so it will vary over the image
TODO: getting tired of hexagonal grid - look into what can be done about that. 
TODO: Make the path to the JSON file settable from the UI.
Then see what else comes to mind.
