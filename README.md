# forsythia_dev
My very messy development sandbox

Using Forsythia Grammar Editor to learn some Java. Added a palette menu and some color palettes. Made the stroke width as thin as possible. 
ToDo: have it read palettes from an external text file. Preferably add something that searches adobe's color api's for palettes. 
Add a menu for stroke width and color. 
Then see what else comes to mind.
