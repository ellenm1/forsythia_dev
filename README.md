DONE: have it read palettes from an external text file, change the palette menu, change the colors in the renderer instance.   
TODO: clean up all the debugging lines and add a default selection in the palette menu.  
TODO: make it all look nicer. Look for UI libraries.  
TODO: Add something that searches adobe's color api's for palettes based on keywords, reads a color.adobe.com palette by name or whatever makes sense.   
TODO Add a menu for stroke width and color.  
TODO: Make the path to the JSON file settable from the UI.
Then see what else comes to mind.
